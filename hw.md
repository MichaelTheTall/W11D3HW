# Debuggery in IntelliJ IDEA

## 1) What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
A breakpoint is a 'pause' or 'stop' marker that pauses/stops the program at that point so a developer can     see what the program is doing.

## 2) Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
The line of code on a breakpoint does NOT run when you start debugging.  

## 3) How do we debug the next line of code?
Click the "Step Over" button, which will run the breakpoint line and then pause again.  

## 4) What does the step into command do?
Step Into runs the next method, then opens it and pauses.  

## 5) What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate Expression evaluates a single line.
Evaluate Code Fragment evaluates a selection of code, so you can evaluate loops and if/else statements.
